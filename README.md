# Neural-network-Perceptron
I have learnt the basic function and some rules of neural network; such as 
1. Perceptron, 
2. Hebbian,  
3. Pseudo-Inverse.

With this project, we will conduct a real case to reveal all these rules:
1.	Do training to get the weights by all the different rules;
2.	Test the weights by all the original data, and the original data changed with 1 pixel, 2 pixels, and 3 pixels;
3.	Then, compare all the rules’ results to check the difference.

Develop Tools: MATLAB R2018a.
Program running help: for each part you can see the related program file name followed by each part’s title, then in the MATLAB under the files’ directory, type “help [file Name]” to get running help.

For the project basic background, you can check in the "project.pdf".
